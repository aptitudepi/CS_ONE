- Create a program called `WhileLoops.java`
- Prompt the user for a number
- Using a while loop, print the square of all numbers from 1 to that number
- Print a blank line after the while loop
- Using another while loop, calculate the sum of all numbers from 1 to that number
- Print the sum
- Using another while loop, calculate the factorial of that number
  - Remember, factorial is the product of an integer and all the integers below it
  - Ex. 4 factorial (written as 4!) is 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 which is 24
- Print the factorial
