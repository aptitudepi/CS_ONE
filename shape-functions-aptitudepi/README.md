- Create a program called `ShapeFunctions.java`
- Write a function to calculate the area of a triangle given the base and the height
- Write a function to calculate the area of a rectangle given the length and the width
- Write a function to calculate the area of a square given the length of one side
- Write a function to calculate the area of a circle given the radius
- In the main method:
  - Prompt the user for a filename
  - The first line in the file contains the number of lines you will read in
  - Read in all the lines in the file and store them in an array of Strings
  - For each shape, call the corresponding function to calculate its area and print the result formatted to two decimal places
