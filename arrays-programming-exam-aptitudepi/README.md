# Arrays Programming Exam

## Due: End of class

## You get one submission attempt. I will only grade your earliest commit

### No using notes, previous programs, Google, or your classmates

- Open the file `ArraysExam.java`
  - I have given you some starter code since you cannot use notes or previous programs
- Complete the following tasks
- Task 1
  - Prompt the user for a number
    - This will be the number of values the user will enter
  - Prompt the user for that many numbers and store them in an array
  - After you have read in all the values:
    - Count how many values in the array are greater than 7
    - Count how many values are less than 7
    - Output those counts
    - Print all the values in the array separated by spaces
- Task 2
  - Prompt the user for another number
    - This will be the number of values the user will enter
  - Prompt the user for that many numbers and store them in another array
  - After you have read in all the values:
    - Calculate the sum of all the odd values in the array
    - Calculate the sum of all the values in the array at even indexes
    - Output those values
    - Print all the values in the array separated by spaces
